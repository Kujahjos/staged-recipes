  summary: A fast K-mer counter for high-fidelity shotgun datasets
  description: |
    FastK is a kâ€‘mer counter that is optimized for processing high quality 
    DNA assembly data sets such as those produced with an Illumina instrument 
    or a PacBio run in HiFi mode. For example it is about 2 times faster than 
    KMC3 when counting 40-mers in a 50X HiFi data set. Its relative speedup 
    decreases with increasing error rate or increasing values of k, but 
    regardless is a general program that works for any DNA sequence data set and 
    choice of k. It is further designed to handle data sets of arbitrarily large size, 
    e.g. a 100X data set of a 32GB Axolotl genome (3.2Tbp) can be performed on a 
    machine with just 12GB of memory provided it has ~6.5TB of disk space available.
